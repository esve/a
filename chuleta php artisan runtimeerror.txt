You are welcome. The php artisan clear-compiled command had to be run before the framework was updated. That why it didn't work and you had to delete vendor/compiled.php manually.

I use a tiny update script to make sure I do not forget:

php artisan down
php artisan clear-compiled
composer update --no-dev
php artisan optimize
php artisan up
Edit: Make sure you run php artisan optimize after the update to rebuild compiled.php.
