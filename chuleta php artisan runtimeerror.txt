You are welcome. The php artisan clear-compiled command had to be run before the framework was updated. That why it didn't work and you had to delete vendor/compiled.php manually.

I use a tiny update script to make sure I do not forget:

php artisan down
php artisan clear-compiled
composer update --no-dev
//
//composer dump-autoload
//
php artisan optimize
php artisan up


Edit: Make sure you run php artisan optimize after the update 
to rebuild compiled.php.



config/app.php 

debug => false, para poder generar el compiled.php con php artisan optimizer
